## About The Project

The [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) (also known as 3n + 1 problem, the 3n + 1 conjecture, the Ulam conjecture, Kakutani’s problem, the Thwaites conjecture, Hasse’s algorithm, or the Syracuse problem) is a simple mathematical conjecture proposed by [Lothar Collatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lothar_Collatz). The problem is as follows: pick any number `n`. If `n` is even, multiply it by three and then add one. Otherwise, if `n` is odd, divide it by two. The result then becomes `n`. Finally, repeat the process. The conjecture states that any positive integer should end up in a loop of `4 -> 2 -> 1`. This is what is being tested.

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/Tehcn/CollatzConjecture/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
